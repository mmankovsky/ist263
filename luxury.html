    <b>Mercedes S580 Starting at $109,800</b>
The Mercedes S class has always been the ultimate luxury sedan. Literally known as one of the best cars on
the road. This car checks off everything from luxury to speed. The length of the luxury sedan has made it
very appealing for the rich and famous to use this vehicle with a driver because it is just so comfortable
back there. The driving capability of the car has been more advanced than the average vehicle for at least
the past 10 years. The new infotainment system is modeled off the Tesla that has the large iPad looking
touch screen in the center console. The vehicle has been renowned for its array of luxury features and
driving capabilities.

   <b>BMW 750i Starting at $87,795</b>
    The BMW extra-long sedan has always been the biggest competitor of the Mercedes S class. The two have
    been atop the luxury sedan world for a very long time. The BMW still gives off the same luxurious and
    comfortable features, but has much more of a sporty feel to it. Although the BMW is much sporty and
    louder it isn’t that much faster than the Mercedes. Only a half second actually going 0-60mph. The BMW
    gives you everything you need in a luxury sedan with the extra leg room, rear mirrors for the passengers,
    and the reclining seats in the back. With the speed and luxury of this car it will always be just under the S
    class because some believe it to be too sporty for a luxury car

<b>Mercedes GLE Starting at $56,750</b>
The Mercedes GLE previously known as the ML is the Mercedes SUV to get. When Mercedes released its
first SUV in 1997, the ML, it was the hottest thing to hit the market and was selling like no other
unexpectedly. The factory was very shocked on how fast the units were selling and didn’t have enough
man power to keep producing them without back orders. Its new updated cabin has been very appealing
as it has taken on the old look of the S class infotainment system. The car is very upscale appealing and it is
also spacious holding a third row

   <b>Porsche Cayenne Starting at $68,850</b>
    The Porsche Cayenne was a very unexpected release to the car world in 2003 when it released an SUV.
    Porsche was known for always having the most high end driving vehicle. Porsche has always advertised
    itself as a drivers vehicle meaning it is meant for someone who knows how to appreciate a real driving
    machine. The Cayenne did just that from higher up. Not only does the car hold to its name of being fast
    and driving well it is also very luxurious. The car is still meant to stand up to the needs of someone needing
    a luxury SUV while still trying to give the best driving experience possible.
